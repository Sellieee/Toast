# Toast
Coding Bootcamp Project 2

Toast allows you to create online invitations. First select your template, type in your details and send it via email to your loved ones and friends, who can then RSVP with their dietary requirements and +1 details!
You can choose to authenticate locally or via Facebook. 
As a host, you can track who's coming and who they're bringing - so you can keep planning your party based on the numbers attending!
